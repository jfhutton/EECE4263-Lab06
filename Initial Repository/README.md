# Lab06 

In this lab youâ€™ll modify your Lab03 ETHOS program to create ETHOS-e, a less power-hungry temperature and humidity measuring device. Because ETHOS-e requires much less power than the original ETHOS, it is ideally suited for battery-powered operations, such as remote environmental monitoring. At its core, ETHOS-e measures and reports temperature and relative humidity information just like ETHOS did, but ETHOS was quite inefficient since its ESP8266 microcontroller was powered up 100% of the time, but spent much of that time doing nothing or waiting for input from the serial menu system.

This two-week lab has three turn-ins: The hardcopy lab handout with all questions answered, an attached one-page Power Analysis report, a live demo of your working ETHOS system, and your program code saved in the Lab06 GitHub assignment repo.

Enjoy!
